## CG21111A Helper Tool (Baremetal :P)

1. Another lazy tool for my lazy ass (I read tables slowly that's why). Not comprehensive as I decided to just include those tables that I frequently use and see in CG2111A quizzes. Feel free to add in any new tables that you feel is necessary
2. Might be helpful in CG2111A quizzes (Quiz 1 specifically) - If they still offer online assessment
3. Timer 1 not included, but I think the tables are not far apart IIRC
4. Have fun as usual

**How to Use?
- You can either clone the repo and open it with Visual Studio OR open the Source.cpp file and copy the code into any C++ IDE
