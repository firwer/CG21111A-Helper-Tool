CG21111A

1. Another lazy tool for my lazy ass. Not comprehensive as I decided to just include those tables that I frequently use and see in CG2111A quizzes. Feel free to add in any new tables that you feel is necessary
2. Might be helpful in CG2111A quizzes (Quiz 1 specifically) - If they still offer online assessment
3. Timer 1 not included, but I think the tables are not far apart IIRC
4. Have fun as usual
